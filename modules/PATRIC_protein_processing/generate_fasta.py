This file implements a GeneSys task that allows the user to
read a csv file with one column that corresponds to BVRC codes,
obtain the appropiate gene sequences associated with each code and
store all of them in a .fasta file while filtering repeated sequences.
It is exclusively aimed to work with BVRC codes from
PATRIC databases.
